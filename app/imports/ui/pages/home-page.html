      <h3 class="ui header">ICS students often spend more time than they need on their homework and donâ€™t learn the material as effectively as they could, because they study alone and do not leverage the power of face-to-face study groups with peer mentors.</h3>
      <h3 class="ui header">So, this website, Study Buddy is a website for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic!</h3>
